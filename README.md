# Introduction

This book is a collection of good practices and Q&As from Reddit, Discourse, Slack and Medium. It will cover things that are missing in the [official guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/) and the [Beginning Elm Book](https://elmprogramming.com/) by Pawan Poudel.

## Motivation

In the [Elm Town Podcast 45: It Started off As a Morning Book](https://elmtown.simplecast.fm/it-started-off-as-a-morning-book) Jeremy Fairbank, the author of the Book [Programming Elm](https://programming-elm.com/), noticed that there is no Elm cookbook, that would serve as a follow-up book.

Elm-Cookbook is a collection of helpful answers from the [Elm subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/elm/), the [Discourse forum](https://discourse.elm-lang.org/), the [Elm Slack](https://elmlang.slack.com) as well as useful articles from [Medium](https://medium.com/tag/elm).

Each section will focus on one specific problem and a one solution. At the end of each section will be links to the original source as well alternative solutions.
